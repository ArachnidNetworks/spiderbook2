# Spiderbook v2
### Website made for the Arachnid network. All users are anonymous, but their hashed IP's will be put in the database for spammers and other rule violators.

The backend is being made with Python, with Flask taking care of requests. It will use a PostgreSQL database.

TODO:
- Database creation file to reproduce it
- Page navigation
- A way to authenticate yourself as an admin
- Admin dashboard to ban users or delete posts
- Some kind of button to go back to the home page
- Video support
- Bug fixes
